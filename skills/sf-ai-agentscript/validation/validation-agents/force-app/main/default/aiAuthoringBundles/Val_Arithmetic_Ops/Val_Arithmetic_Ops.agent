# Val_Arithmetic_Ops - Tests arithmetic operators (+, -)
# Purpose: Verify expression operators work as documented
#
# Tests:
#   ✓ Addition: @variables.total = @variables.total + 1
#   ✓ Subtraction: @variables.total = @variables.total - 1
#   ✓ Variables in arithmetic expressions
#
# SKILL.md Section: Expression Operators
# Note: Only + and - are supported. *, /, % are NOT supported.
